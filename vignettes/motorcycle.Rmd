This vignette gives a demonstration of the package on emulating the popular motorcycle dataset [@silverman1985].

## Load packages and data

We start by loading packages:

```{r}
library(dgpsi)
library(MASS)
library(patchwork)
```

We now load the training data points,

```{r}
X <- mcycle$times
Y <- mcycle$accel
```

scale them,

```{r}
X <- (X - min(X))/(max(X)-min(X))
Y <- scale(Y, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)
```

and plot them:

```{r}
plot(X, Y, pch = 16, cex = 1, xlab = 'Time', ylab = 'Acceleration', cex.axis = 1.3, cex.lab = 1.3)
```

Before constructing an emulator, we first specify a seed with `set_seed()` from the package for reproducibility

```{r}
set_seed(9999)
```

and split a training data set and a testing data set:

```{r}
test_idx <- sample(seq_len(length(X)), size = 20)
train_X <- X[-test_idx]
train_Y <- Y[-test_idx,]
test_x <- X[test_idx]
test_y <- Y[test_idx,]
```

## Construct and train a DGP emulator

We consider a three-layered DGP emulator with squared exponential kernels and heteroskedastic likelihood:

```{r}
m_dgp <- dgp(train_X, train_Y, depth = 3, likelihood = "Hetero")
```

```
## Auto-generating a 3-layered DGP structure ... done
## Initializing the DGP emulator ... done
## Training the DGP emulator: 
## Iteration 500: Layer 3: 100%|██████████| 500/500 [00:14<00:00, 35.52it/s]
## Imputing ... done
```

We choose a heteroskedastic Gaussian likelihood by setting `likelihood = "Hetero"` since the data drawn in the plot show varying noise. We can use `summary()` to visualize the structure and specifications for the trained DGP emulator:

```{r}
summary(m_dgp)
```

For comparison, we also build a GP emulator (by `gp()`) that incorporates homogeneous noise by setting `nugget_est = T` and the initial nugget value to $0.01$:

```{r}
m_gp <- gp(train_X, train_Y, nugget_est = T, nugget = 1e-2) 
```

```
## Auto-generating a GP structure ... done
## Initializing the GP emulator ... done
## Training the GP emulator ... done
```

We can also summarize the trained GP emulator by `summary()`:

```{r}
summary(m_gp)
```

## Validation

We are now ready to validate both emulators via `validate()` at the 20 out-of-sample testing positions generated earlier:

```{r}
m_dgp <- validate(m_dgp, test_x, test_y)
```

```
## Initializing the OOS ... done
## Calculating the OOS ... done
## Saving results to the slot 'oos' in the dgp object ... done
```

```{r}
m_gp <- validate(m_gp, test_x, test_y)
```

```
## Initializing the OOS ... done
## Calculating the OOS ... done
## Saving results to the slot 'oos' in the gp object ... done
```

Note that using `validate()` before plotting can save subsequent computations compared to simply invoking `plot()`, as `validate()` stores validation results in the emulator objects and plot will use these if it can to avoid calculating them on the fly. Finally, we plot the OOS validation for the GP emulator:

```{r}
plot(m_gp, test_x, test_y)
```

```
## Validating and computing ... done
## Post-processing OOS results ... done
## Plotting ... done
```

and for the DGP emulator:

```{r}
plot(m_dgp, test_x, test_y)
```

```
## Validating and computing ... done
## Post-processing OOS results ... done
## Plotting ... done
```

Note that we still need to provide `test_x` and `test_y` to `plot()` even they have already been provided to `validate()`. Otherwise, `plot()` will draw a LOO cross validation plot. The visualizations above show that the DGP emulator gives a better performance than the GP emulator on modeling the heteroskedastic noise embedded in the underlying data set, even though they have quite similar NRMSEs.
