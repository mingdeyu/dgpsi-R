# Static pruning of a DGP emulator

This function implements static pruning for a DGP emulator.

## Usage

``` r
prune(object, control = list(), verb = TRUE)
```

## Arguments

- object:

  an instance of the `dgp` class that is generated by
  [`dgp()`](http://mingdeyu.github.io/dgpsi-R/dev/reference/dgp.md).

- control:

  a list that can supply the following two components to control static
  pruning of the DGP emulator:

  - `min_size`, the minimum number of design points required to trigger
    pruning. Defaults to 10 times of the input dimensions.

  - `threshold`, the \\R^2\\ value above which a GP node is considered
    redundant and removable. Defaults to `0.97`.

- verb:

  a bool indicating if trace information will be printed during the
  function execution. Defaults to `TRUE`.

## Value

An updated `object` that could be an instance of `gp`, `dgp`, or
`bundle` (of GP emulators) class.

## Details

See further examples and tutorials at
<https://mingdeyu.github.io/dgpsi-R/dev/>.

## Note

- The function requires a DGP emulator that has been trained with a
  dataset comprising a minimum size equal to `min_size` in `control`. If
  the training dataset size is smaller than this, it is recommended that
  the design of the DGP emulator is enriched and its structure pruned
  dynamically using the
  [`design()`](http://mingdeyu.github.io/dgpsi-R/dev/reference/design.md)
  function. Depending on the design of the DGP emulator, static pruning
  may not be accurate. It is thus recommended that dynamic pruning is
  implemented as a part of a sequential design via
  [`design()`](http://mingdeyu.github.io/dgpsi-R/dev/reference/design.md).

- The following slots:

  - `loo` and `oos` created by
    [`validate()`](http://mingdeyu.github.io/dgpsi-R/dev/reference/validate.md);
    and

  - `results` created by
    [`predict()`](http://mingdeyu.github.io/dgpsi-R/dev/reference/predict.md);

  in `object` will be removed and not contained in the returned object.

## Examples

``` r
if (FALSE) { # \dontrun{

# load the package and the Python env
library(dgpsi)

# construct the borehole function over a hypercube
f <- function(x){
  x[,1] <- (0.15 - 0.5) * x[,1] + 0.5
  x[,2] <- exp((log(50000) - log(100)) * x[,2] + log(100))
  x[,3] <- (115600 - 63070) *x[,3] + 63070
  x[,4] <- (1110 - 990) * x[,4] + 990
  x[,5] <- (116 - 63.1) * x[,5] + 63.1
  x[,6] <- (820 - 700) * x[,6] + 700
  x[,7] <- (1680 - 1120) * x[,7] + 1120
  x[,8] <- (12045 - 9855) * x[,8] + 9855
  y <- apply(x, 1, RobustGaSP::borehole)
}

# set a random seed
set_seed(999)

# generate training data
X <- maximinLHS(80, 8)
Y <- f(X)

# generate validation data
validate_x <- maximinLHS(500, 8)
validate_y <- f(validate_x)

# training a DGP emulator with anisotropic squared exponential kernels
m <- dgp(X, Y, share = F)

# OOS validation of the DGP emulator
plot(m, validate_x, validate_y)

# prune the emulator until no more GP nodes are removable
m <- prune(m)

# OOS validation of the resulting emulator
plot(m, validate_x, validate_y)
} # }
```
