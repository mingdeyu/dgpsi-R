\title{Save the constructed emulator}
\usage{
write(object, pkl_file, light = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{an instance of the S3 class \code{gp}, \code{dgp}, \code{lgp}, or \code{bundle}.}

\item{pkl_file}{the path to and the name of the \code{.pkl} file to which
the emulator \code{object} is saved.}

\item{light}{a bool indicating if a light version of the constructed emulator (that requires a small storage) will be saved.
Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
No return value. \code{object} will be save to a local \code{.pkl} file specified by \code{pkl_file}.
}
\description{
This function saves the constructed emulator to a \code{.pkl} file.

\details{

}
\note{
Since the constructed emulators are 'python' objects, \code{\link[=save]{save()}} from R will not work as it is only for R objects. If \code{object}
was processed by \code{\link[=set_vecchia]{set_vecchia()}} to add or remove the Vecchia approximation, \code{light} needs to be set to \code{FALSE} to ensure
reproducibility after the saved emulator is loaded by \code{\link[=read]{read()}}, since when \code{light = TRUE}, the imputations generated during
emulator loading will be different.
