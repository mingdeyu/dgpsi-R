\title{Pack GP and DGP emulators into a bundle}
\usage{
pack(...)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{a sequence of emulators produced by \code{\link[=gp]{gp()}} or \code{\link[=dgp]{dgp()}}.}
}
\value{
An S3 class named \code{bundle} to be used by \code{\link[=design]{design()}} for sequential designs. It has:
\itemize{
\item \emph{N} slots named \verb{emulator1,...,emulatorN}, each of which contains a GP or DGP emulator, where \emph{N} is the number of emulators
that are provided to the function.
\item a slot called \code{data} which contains two elements \code{X} and \code{Y}. \code{X} contains \emph{N} matrices named \verb{emulator1,...,emulatorN} that are
training input data for different emulators. \code{Y} contains \emph{N} single-column matrices named \verb{emulator1,...,emulatorN} that are
training output data for different emulators.
}
}
\description{
This function packs GP emulators and DGP emulators (without likelihood layers) into a \code{bundle} class for
sequential designs if each emulator emulates one output dimension of the underlying simulator.
